### Chunking

In this project I am using docling and lanngchain to convert simple pdf's into text chunks.

### LanceDB

LanceDB is an embedded database that persists vectorial and non-vectorial data. In this case I mainly use it to convert captions that accompany images to a vector.

The vector can be used to perform a ssemantic search. By applying some simple vector arithmetic to the embeddings, lanceDB allows us to manipulate the embeddings in ways that capture complex relationships and nuances in the data.
